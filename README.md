# Yeemazon
Yeemazon is an amazon clone, the name inspired by our teacher, Mr Yee. Yeemazon utilizes many different security features to protect the data of our users. We use Bcrypt to secure and store users passwords, IP Verification emails to allow entry to new computers accessing your account, and finally we utilize Recaptca to reduce bot spam and account creation. We are currently working on adding items, switching to MongoDB, and the ability to create items for vendors to sell on our website. This is an amazon clone and does not actually use real money or items. This project was created to demonstrate the abilities of our group.
